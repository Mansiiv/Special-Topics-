# Long Video Sumarization and Medium Article Writing with Gemini's Largest Experimental Model

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Gemini's largest experimental model to summarize lengthy videos from recent state-of-the-art AI technology conferences and discussions. The primary aim is to distill these lengthy sessions, which often exceed two hours, into digestible summaries, key takeaways, and compelling Medium articles. Furthermore, the project entails the creation of LaTeX-based slideshow presentations to visually represent the summarized content.

## Objectives

- **Summarize Long Videos**: Automate the generation of concise summaries for extended AI discussions.
- **Extract Key Takeaways**: Identify and document the crucial insights and points from the talks.
- **Article Generation**: Transform summaries and takeaways into well-structured Medium articles.

## Project Components

### Video Selection

- Choose a recent AI-related conference talk or discussion that is cutting edge and lasts for more than two hours.
- Ensure the video is from a credible source and covers significant advancements or discussions in AI.

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Transcription**:
   - Automatically transcribe the entire video using AI-based speech-to-text services to capture detailed dialogue and discussions.

   - Utilize Gemini's model to condense the transcribed text into a comprehensive summary that captures the essence of the discussions.

3. **Key Takeaways**:
   - Extract important insights and actionable points using advanced text analysis techniques.

4. **Article Writing**:
   - Convert the summaries and key takeaways into a Medium article formatted for public engagement and sharing.

5. **Slideshow Preparation**:
   - Create a LaTeX presentation that outlines the summarized content in a visually appealing manner for academic or professional audiences.

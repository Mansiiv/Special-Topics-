# Multimodal AI Capabilities Project

## Overview

This project explores the advanced multimodal capabilities of AI models such as Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4, demonstrating their proficiency across different domains such as coding, video processing, image analysis, and more. The project is encapsulated in a Google Colab notebook that provides interactive examples and demonstrations.

## Objectives

- **Showcase Multimodal Interactions**: Demonstrate how AI models handle different types of data including text, video, audio, and images.
- **Cover Multiple Domains**: Provide examples in domains such as coding, video editing, image processing, healthcare, finance, education, content generation, legal analysis, gaming, and robotics.
- **Educational Purpose**: Help users understand the potential applications and benefits of integrating AI in various fields.

Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time based on the data they are exposed to.\n",

            "* **Algorithms:** These are the mathematical instructions that process the data.  Different algorithms are suited for different tasks and types of data.  Examples include:\n",
            "    * **Supervised learning:** The algorithm learns from labeled data (data where the desired output is known).  Examples include image classification (identifying objects in images) and spam detection.\n",
            "    * **Unsupervised learning:** The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, identifying patterns and structures within the data.  Examples include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of variables while retaining important information).\n",
            "    * **Reinforcement learning:** The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.  Examples include game playing (like AlphaGo) and robotics.\n",

They don't typically boast about the underlying technology as much as they showcase the improved user experience it provides.  Features like Siri, personalized recommendations in Apple Music and the App Store, and image processing in Photos are all powered by AI, but the AI itself is largely invisible to the user.\n",

Their AI models are often trained on-device or with strong privacy-preserving techniques to minimize data collection and sharing. This contrasts with some competitors who leverage vast datasets collected from users.\n",

Their Neural Engine, a dedicated hardware component in their chips, is a prime example of this approach.\n",

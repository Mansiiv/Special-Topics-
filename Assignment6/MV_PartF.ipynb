        "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, to the extent that it negatively impacts the model's performance on new, unseen data. An overfitted model essentially memorizes the training data instead of generalizing from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This usually happens when the model is too complex relative to the size and quality of the training dataset. Overfitting can be identified when the model performs very well on training data but poorly on validation or test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To prevent overfitting, techniques such as cross-validation, regularization (e.g., L1, L2), reducing model complexity, pruning decision trees, or using more training data can be applied. Dropout and early stopping are also commonly used in neural networks to address this issue."

# Assignment: Deep Learning Implementations in Colab

This project encompasses the implementation of **NanoGPT** from scratch and a case study based on **"Textbooks are All You Need"** using modular code and state-of-the-art debugging practices. All artifacts, including Colab notebooks, presentations, input/output data, and a Medium article, are provided.

## NanoGPT Implementation

### a) Description
Recreating **NanoGPT** from scratch using **PyTorch**, inspired by the [original Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JMLa53HDuA-i7ZBmqV7ZnA3c_fvtXnx-) and [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=18s). The implementation includes:
- A modular codebase for easier readability and debugging.
- Comprehensive debugging comparable to the original NanoGPT Colab.
- Training the model on a new dataset (different from Shakespeare) to demonstrate adaptability.

### Key Requirements
- **Modular Code**: Clear separation of components (tokenizer, model architecture, training loop, etc.).
- **Debugging**: Include assertions, logging, and dynamic visualization during training.
- **Dataset**: Use a custom text dataset, such as an e-book or a collection of articles, instead of Shakespeare.
- **Artifacts**:
  - Colab notebook with full implementation.
  - Medium article explaining the code sections in detail.
  - Trained model weights, input, and output data.
  - A 10-minute presentation walking through the implementation step-by-step.

## Case Study: Textbooks Are All You Need

### b) Description
Replicating the **"Textbooks are All You Need"** case study using a smaller dataset in **Colab Pro (A100 GPU)**. This involves:
- Leveraging **Jina AI's framework** ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jina-ai/textbook)) and adapting it to custom data.
- Utilizing the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11644.pdf) as a theoretical guide.
- Implementing the pipeline for model training and evaluation with **reduced data size**.

### Key Requirements
- **Data Preparation**: Process and format a smaller dataset.
- **Model Training**: Optimize model performance using available resources on Colab Pro with A100 GPU.
- **Analysis**:
  - Comparison of training performance with results from the original implementation.
  - Highlighting limitations due to the smaller dataset size.
- **Artifacts**:
  - Full Colab notebook with implementation.
  - Trained model outputs and metrics.
  - A short presentation explaining the pipeline and results.

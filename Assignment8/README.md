# End-to-End LLMOps Generative AI Application

This repository contains an end-to-end application demonstrating LLMOps practices to build, deploy, and manage a Generative AI-powered system. The project is inspired by cutting-edge frameworks and tools to create production-ready LLM-based applications, with a focus on operationalizing LLM workflows for real-world use cases.

## **Overview**
This project showcases how to design, implement, and operationalize a Generative AI application using Large Language Models (LLMs). The application integrates data preprocessing, fine-tuning, deployment, monitoring, and continuous optimization in a production environment.

### **Features**
- **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Train and adapt pre-trained LLMs to a domain-specific task.
- **Inference Pipeline**: Deploy the LLM for real-time or batch processing.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Use LLMOps principles to monitor performance and capture key metrics.
- **Model Optimization**: Techniques like prompt engineering, LoRA, or adapter-based fine-tuning.
- **End-to-End Automation**: Integrate tools like CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployments.

## **Application Flow**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Collect and clean domain-specific data for fine-tuning.
   - Tokenize and format data for the LLM training pipeline.

2. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune a pre-trained model like GPT, Llama, or OPT on the prepared dataset.
   - Use techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or instruction tuning for resource efficiency.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the fine-tuned LLM in a production environment using frameworks like Hugging Face, Gradio, or FastAPI.
   - Ensure scalability using tools like Kubernetes or Docker.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement observability using platforms like Comet, MLflow, or Azure Monitor.
   - Log key metrics: latency, throughput, and token usage.

5. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Collect user feedback to continuously improve the model via retraining or prompt updates.
